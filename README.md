# EEG-Signal-Decomposition-using-DSP-techniques
 Implement digital filters to extract specific brainwave frequencies from raw EEG data. The brainwave frequencies of interest include Gamma, Beta, Alpha, Theta, and Delta wave.

**Introduction**
Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is a pivotal area in the field of signal analysis and filtering. It plays a critical role in various applications, including bio-signal processing. This code focuses on the utilization of DSP techniques to analyze Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, specifically targeting the extraction of distinct brainwave components. EEG signals are widely employed in neurology and cognitive research to study brain activity patterns associated with different cognitive states. 
The primary objective of this code is to design and implement digital filters to extract specific brainwave frequencies from raw EEG data. The brainwave frequencies of interest include Gamma, Beta, Alpha, Theta, and Delta waves. To achieve this, we employ filter design and signal processing techniques to isolate these brainwave components from the EEG signal.
